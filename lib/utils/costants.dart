String roverText = 'Perseverance is exploring Jezero Crater, a location on Mars that shows promising signs of a place that was likely friendly to life in the distant past. The rover’s goal is to study the site in detail for its past conditions and seek the very signs of past life. It is carrying out its mission to identify and collect the most compelling rock cores and other samples of Mars material, which a future mission could retrieve and bring to Earth for more detailed study.  Perseverance also tests technologies needed for the future human and robotic exploration of Mars. NASA\'s Perseverance rover has been exploring the surface of Mars since landing in February 2021. The rover has made discoveries about the planet\'s volcanic history, climate, surface, interior, habitability, and the role of water in Jezero Crater. ';
String droneIntroText = 'The Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, is strapped to the Mars Perseverance rover\'s belly. It is powered by solar panels that charge lithium-ion batteries, providing enough energy for one 90-second flight per Martian day. On April 19, 2021, NASA\'s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter made history when it completed the first powered, controlled flight on the Red Planet. It flew for the last time on January 18, 2024.';
String droneDescriptionText = 'Designed to be a technology demonstration that would make no more than five test flights in 30 days, the helicopter eventually completed 72 flights in just under three years, soaring higher and faster than previously imagined. Ingenuity embarked on a new mission as an operations demonstration, serving as an aerial scout for scientists and rover planners, and for engineers ready to learn more about Perseverance’s landing gear debris. In its final phase, the helicopter entered a new engineering demonstration phase where it executed experimental flight tests that further expanded the team’s knowledge of the vehicle’s aerodynamic limits.';
